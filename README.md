Commentary
==========

Easily convert elisp file headers to markdown text. The file
comment headers should be similar to this one.

Installation
============

None

Use
===

Invoke this elisp file with emacs --script like so:

    $ emacs --script make-readme-markdown.el < elisp-file-to-parse.el

(Note: you might have to redirect stderr to `/dev/null` to avoid
some pesky "loading vc-git" messages and the like...)

Output is written to stdout.

You can also pass the -nospam switch to prevent the little
"Generated by" text from showing up.

Supported syntax
================

In order for this module to do you any good, you should write your
file header comments in a way that make-readme-markdown.el
understands. An attempt has been made to support the most common
file header comment style, so hopefully you shouldn't have to do
anything... The following patterns at the beginning of a line are
special:

* ';;; My Header' :: Creates a header
* ';;` ' :: Creates a code line (deprecated, see markdown notes below)
* ';; o My list item' :: Creates a list item

Everything else is stripped of its leading semicolons and first
space and is passed directly out. Note that you can embed markdown
syntax directly in your comments. This means that you can embed
blocks of code in your comments by leading the line with 4 spaces
(in addition to the first space directly following the last
semicolon). An example:

My code example:

    (defun strip-comments (line)
      "Stip elisp comments from line"
      (replace-regexp-in-string "^;+ ?" "" line))

We parse everything between `;;; Commentary:' and `;;; Code'. See
make-readme-markdown.el for an example (you might already be
looking at it... whoa, this is really getting meta...).

If there's some more syntax you would like to see supported, submit
