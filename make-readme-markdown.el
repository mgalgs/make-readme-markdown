;;; Commentary:

;; This tool will let you easily convert elisp file headers to markdown text so
;; long as the file comments and documentation follow standard conventions
;; (like this file). This is because when you're writing an elisp module, the
;; module itself should be the canonical source of documentation. But it's not
;; very user-friendly or good marketing for your project to have an empty
;; README.md that refers people to your source code, and it's even worse if you
;; have to maintain two separate files that say the same thing.

;;; Installation:

;; None

;;; Usage:

;; The recommended way to use this tool is by putting the following code in
;; your Makefile and running `make README.md` (You don't even have to clone the
;; repository!):
;;
;;     README.md: make-readme-markdown.el YOUR-MODULE.el
;;     	emacs --script $< <YOUR-MODULE.el >$@ 2>/dev/null
;;
;;     make-readme-markdown.el:
;;     	wget -q -O $@ https://raw.github.com/mgalgs/make-readme-markdown/master/make-readme-markdown.el
;;
;;     .INTERMEDIATE: make-readme-markdown.el
;;
;; You can also invoke it directly with `emacs --script`:
;;
;;     $ emacs --script make-readme-markdown.el <elisp-file-to-parse.el 2>/dev/null
;;
;; All functions and macros in your module with docstrings will be documented
;; in the output unless they've been marked as private. Convention dictates
;; that private elisp functions have two hypens, like `cup--noodle`.

;;; Syntax:

;; In order for this module to do you any good, you should write your
;; file header comments in a way that make-readme-markdown.el
;; understands. An attempt has been made to support the most common
;; file header comment style, so hopefully you shouldn't have to do
;; anything... The following patterns at the beginning of a line are
;; special:
;;
;; o `;;; My Header` :: Creates a header
;; o `;; o My list item` :: Creates a list item
;; o `;; * My list item` :: Also creates a list item
;; o `;; - My list item` :: Also creates a list item
;;
;; Everything else is stripped of its leading semicolons and first
;; space and is passed directly out. Note that you can embed markdown
;; syntax directly in your comments. This means that you can embed
;; blocks of code in your comments by leading the line with 4 spaces
;; (in addition to the first space directly following the last
;; semicolon). For example:
;;
;;     (defun strip-comments (line)
;;       "Stip elisp comments from line"
;;       (replace-regexp-in-string "^;+ ?" "" line))
;;
;; We parse everything between `;;; Commentary:` and `;;; Code`. See
;; make-readme-markdown.el for an example (you might already be
;; looking at it... whoa, this is really getting meta...).
;;
;; If there's some more syntax you would like to see supported, submit
;; an issue at https://github.com/mgalgs/make-readme-markdown/issues
